# Atari Surround RL

This repository implements reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to play the Atari game Surround. The goal is to train agents that can effectively learn and play the game using various RL algorithms.

### Example (Agent is on the Right)

# Key Components
## Agents

BaseAgent: Abstract base class defining the agent interface
ReinforcePolicyGradientsAgent: REINFORCE policy gradient implementation
DQNAgent: Deep Q-Network with prioritized experience replay
DuelingDQNAgent: Dueling DQN architecture with advantage/value streams
RainbowDQNAgent: Advanced DQN with Rainbow enhancements

## Models

MLPBackbone: Multi-layer perceptrons for vector-based observations
CNNBackbone: Convolutional networks for image-based observations
NoisyLinear: Noisy network layers for exploration in Rainbow DQN

## Environment Wrappers

Wrappers for reshaping observations, no-op removal, removing redudant transitions (especially for DQN) in Surround's turn-based system, reward shaping, etc.

## Quick Start 

**Set up the environment:**
```sh
./setup.sh
```

If setup doesn't work due to not automatically activating the conda env, activate it with `conda activate atari` or whatever your env is called and then copy the remaining install commands.
